This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 where the catch-all route ('/*') fails to function correctly.  The issue arises when using the `Routes` component and the catch-all route is not functioning as the last resort for unmatched routes.  The solution provided addresses this problem by ensuring that the catch-all route is properly positioned to handle any unmatched routes.
